<p>Hello. Mark Ruddy here.</p> 

<p>I like to work in lots of different areas: data science, writing about science-related things, and investigating recent Earth history. I live in London, with my wife and two children, and am often to be seen riding bicycles, because they're fun and solve most of the world's problems.</p>

<p>In the past you might have found me drilling holes in the ground to find out about Earth history, or measuring the teeth of small mammals and thinking about evolution.</p>
