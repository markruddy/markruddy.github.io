<p>Hello. Mark Ruddy here.</p> 

<p>I like to work in lots of different areas: data science, writing about science-related things and going out-and-about discovering recent geology.  I live in London, with my wife and two children. I am often to be seen riding bicycles, because they're fun and solve most of the world's problems.</p>

<p>In the past you might have found me drilling holes in the ground to find out about Earth history, or measuring the teeth of small mammals and thinking about evolution.</p>

<p>See things I've <a href="/portfolio/">worked on</a> and maybe <a href="/hire-me/">hire me</a>.</p>

<p>Read a <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Download <a href="/resources/">data and other goodies</a>.</p>

<p>Wondering <a href="/stage5e/">why stage5e</a>?</p>
