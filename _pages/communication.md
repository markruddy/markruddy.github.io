I produce various types of content to help communicate ideas and information for different audiences[^sci-comm-def]. For instance:

[^sci-comm-def]: Here I'm using the term *science communication* in a broad sense to summarise the sorts of activities I'm involved in. This might differ from the [generally understood definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_communication) of science communication.


* Feature or review articles on specific topics
  * eg biofuels, unconventional oil and gas or climate change
* Educational content
  * For non-technical audiences, students, continued professional development
* e-learning courses
  * Content: text, voice-overs, graphics, animations, quizzes
  * Storyboarding and design
* Graphics, data visualisations, maps.

I focus on science, environment, the energy industry, and technical subjects. Have a look at my [portfolio](/collection-archive/) and get in touch.
