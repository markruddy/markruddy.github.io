Data are everywhere. There's a strong desire and need to put data to good use. Data science is concerned with every aspect of this: 

* Transforming to the right shape
* Exploring for insight
* Visualising in a revealing manner
* Modelling appropriately
* Delivering reproducible research

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), databases, GIS and other tools to tidy, explore, and visualise data; deliver reproducible work; and creatively communicate ideas and insights.

My background in Earth and environmental sciences (PhD, MSc, PgDip) has been the springboard to over 10 years' data-oriented experience in public and private sector projects.
