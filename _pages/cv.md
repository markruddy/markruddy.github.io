## Personal Statement

I'm a data-driven scientist using R, SQL, GIS and other tools to tidy, explore, analyse and visualise data; deliver reproducible work; and creatively communicate ideas and insights. I have academic and commercial experience using machine learning and a variety of statistical approaches, use GitHub, have additional experience with python, and am currently training with Hadoop and MapReduce.

My background in Earth, energy, and environmental sciences (PgDip, MSc, PhD) has been the springboard to over 10 years' experience in quantitative public and private sector projects. I am now looking to transition my skillset into a business space working with big data problems.
