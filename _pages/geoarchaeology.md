## What is geoarchaeology?

Geoarchaeology is a discipline that uses geo-science approaches within archaeological investigations. It aims to reconstruct past environments, landscapes, and land use to find out how humans interacted and effected the places they lived in.

In developer-led archaeology, where heritage planning conditions are applied to construction projects, geoarchaeology is often a vital tool for locating, predicting and interpreting buried heritage. This can substantially minimise heritage risk to a project.

This involves deposit mapping and modelling, sediment sampling and palaeoenvironmental interpretation. I can provide help with all aspects of geoarchaeological work, from field and laboratory work to desk-based reporting.

## Field and laboratory services

### Watching briefs

Watching briefs are monitoring exercises. They often arise as planning conditions where there is thought to be low potential for heritage but the possibility that something important might be present. 

Examples of sites where such a watching brief is needed are where old land surfaces that show signs of occupation might be present, geologically important stratigraphy or buried landscape features.

### Trial pits and cross sections

Viewing a cross section through the ground can be a valuable and rapid way of evaluating buried heritage. Trial pits and cut exposures extending a few metres below ground can provide this.

Sediments can be sampled in bulk or as overlapping monolith tins through the cut face. Samples can then be processed or subsampled in the laboratory for palaeoenvironmental evidence, artifactual remains, and radiocarbon dating.

### Boreholes

Borehole evaluations can be an extremely effective, low-cost, low-impact method for appraising the archaeological potential at a site and for carrying out larger-scale investigations. A number of different types of drilling equipment can be used, each suited to different site conditions and study requirements.

*Cable percussion*

Cable percussion drilling can recover a substantial, undisturbed core of sediment. This gives a snapshot of stratigraphy and provides many sub-sampling opportunities for palaeoenvironmental analysis and dating. This drilling method may be used as part of a full investigation when there is thought to be low to moderate potential for archaeological heritage but high to moderate palaeoenvironmental potential and significance. The equipment has a fairly large footprint so is not well suited to confined spaces, small or busy sites with poor access.

*Window samples*

Window sampling is generally a lighter weight alternative to cable percussion drilling. It is a useful approach for rapid site evaluations that uses mobile and compact equipment that can easily fit around other site operations. The process involves capturing sediment in open-ended steel barrels, typically a metre long, that are driven into the ground. Filled barrels are pulled to the surface and another empty tube is driven down to extend the borehole.

Window samplers can be machine-mounted (‘Terrier rigs’ or ‘Comacchio rigs’) or hand operated percussive hammers (‘power auger’). Depths of around 10m can be reached by Terrier rigs but more powerful Comacchio rigs are capable of reaching depths of 50m and can cope with a wider variety of sediment types. 

Hand-held percussive hammers can gain access to locations where commercial drilling rigs cannot go such as deep or narrow trenches, basements, or rugged terrain. They are also much less expensive than rigs. However, they rarely drill to depths of more than 10m even in the most favourable conditions.

### Laboratory services

In a clean laboratory environment the tubes are split open and the sedimentary succession is recorded. Sub-samples are taken from specific depositional units to look for palaeoenvironmental evidence such as preserved pollen, insect remains, or the shells of small aquatic species such as diatoms or ostracods. Samples can also be sent for scientific dating such as carbon-14 dating.


## Desk-based assessments (DBAs) and reports

Early assessment of buried heritage using the literature, geotechnical data and deposit modelling can significantly minimise risk for development projects. Final reporting of an investigation provides publication standard interpretation and analysis of results.

The DBA guides the next steps in the heritage assessment process. A watching brief, field evaluation or full site investigation may be recommended based on information that the DBA provides.

Final reporting of evaluation or post-excavation work includes synthesis of specialist reports, relevant maps and illustrations, interpretation and recommendations.

### Deposit modelling

Deposit modelling is a powerful approach to understanding archaeological sites, past landscapes and formation processes. Information from boreholes on lithostratigraphy allows the sub-surface geometry and extent of sediments to be estimated. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and borehole transects are used to establish and visualise these models.
