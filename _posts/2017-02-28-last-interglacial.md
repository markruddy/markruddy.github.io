I've spent a large part of my career thinking and working on recent Earth history. I decided to give a nod to this in my website's title. 'Stage5e' sounds suitably abstract (like [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)) but will mean something to some people - giving me a nice, warm, fuzzy, self-satisfied feeling in the process... I digress.

## Past climate 

Earth's climate has periodically shifted between cold and warm intervals over the last few hundred thousand years. Warm periods - called interglacials - are labelled with odd numbers; cold periods - glacials - with even numbers. Stage 5e was the last interglacial[^stage3-fn] and occurred 120,000 years ago. 

The plot below presents a key source of evidence for the global nature of climate shifts. Sediment cores [drilled from the seafloor](http://www.odplegacy.org/) contain the calcium carbonate shell remains of [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera). Analysing the relative proprtions of oxygen stable isotopes <sup>18</sup>O and <sup>16</sup>O from foram shells is a [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)) for the volume of water locked up in major ice sheets during the time each shell was built. This is because during glacials the light isotope of oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O) is preferentially locked up in ice, and the oceans [become enriched](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology_OxygenBalance/) in <sup>18</sup>O as a result. Marine oxygen isotopes give us the ability to view climate shifts on the grand scale; resulting in each climate flip being given the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) stage names mentioned above. The peaks in the &delta;<sup>18</sup>O plot are interglacials and the troughs are glacials.

MIS stage 5e appears to have been a warmer interglacial that one we're currently in - stage 1, AKA the Holocene[^temp-fn] - and an interesting biogeographic story exists for island Britain during this period. Conditions then were warm enough to allow present-day African animals like hippos, elephants and lions to colonise [London](http://london-nerc-dtp.org/2016/02/10/a-past-paradise-in-central-london/) and even reach as far north as [northern England](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.64382). There were no humans in Britain in MIS 5e (as far as we know), and no evidence for horses either. Globally, sea-levels were a few metres higher than historical records and ice-sheets were smaller <a href="#sources">(Brown, 2011)</a>.

In a post-anthropogenic global warming world MIS 5e could serve as a model for how the Earth system responds to higher temperatures <a href="#sources">(Brown, 2011)</a>, for instance [sea-level change](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6322/276). There's little chance we will limit warming to [below 1.5&deg;C](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-only-five-years-left-before-one-point-five-c-budget-is-blown), so learning from past climates can give us insights into how to prepare for what's to come in the future.


[^stage3-fn]: What about stage 3? Well, that doesn't count as an interglacial as it was too cold but for historical reasons was labelled as one - *sigh*.

[^temp-fn]: At least up until the onset of human interference with the climate system following the industrial revolution in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.
